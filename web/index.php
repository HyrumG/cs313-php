      <p>I love Formula One racing. I would say that my love for Formula One came suddenly. I love racing games, mostly the Gran Turismo franchise.
          One day I went on YouTube to check out the new game that came out at the time. While watching one of the videos, I 
          noticed that there was video gameplay footage of Formula One. I have always been intrigued by Formula One so I decided
          to watch it. Needless to say, I became hooked. I'm embarrassed to admit how many videos I have watched. Fast-forward a 
          few weeks, I began to follow the real races that go on throughout the world on YouTube. Since then, I have yet to miss
          a race related video of Formula One.
